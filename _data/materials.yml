  content-1: "In countries where coronaviruses cause disease, there is increasing support for putting an end to the use of experimental antiviral drugs. Some specialist groups fear that this will mean a shift in guidelines that could be catastrophic for those on the frontline.
  As a result, they are asking the public to step up and show their concerns in a public petition: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/6811/release-the-carcass-specimens-for-the-science-community"

  title-2: "Tech giants struggle to stem 'infodemic' of false coronavirus claims"
  content-2: "Click over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.
  The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.
  There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.
  Algorithms and user-generated content are out; gatekeepers and fact checking are in.
  Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.
  Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined."
