  title-2: "'We'll disappear': Thousands of Mexican women strike to protest femicide in Mexico"
  content-2: "More than 500,000 people attended rallies across Mexico on Saturday to denounce violence against women, in a demonstration that also called for the law to be modified.

  The gathering of marches marked International Women's Day, a day on which women's rights advocates work to highlight gender discrimination."
