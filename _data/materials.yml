      content: "In countries where coronaviruses cause disease, there is increasing support for putting an end to the use of experimental antiviral drugs. Some specialist groups fear that this will mean a shift in guidelines that could be catastrophic for those on the frontline.
  As a result, they are asking the public to step up and show their concerns in a public petition: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/6811/release-the-carcass-specimens-for-the-science-community"

      content: "More than 500,000 people attended rallies across Mexico on Saturday to denounce violence against women, in a demonstration that also called for the law to be modified.
  Women marched alongside men calling for a constitutional reform to prevent violence against women, and staged marches of their own.
  The gathering of marches marked International Women's Day, a day on which women's rights advocates work to highlight gender discrimination."

      title: "AI researchers debate the ethics of sharing potentially harmful programs"
      content: "Noonan also went on to argue that AI is more than a buzzword, explaining that 'programs are not neutral; they have effects.' Because of the importance of ethics in AI research, she argued that 'no one ever sat down and wrote a paper' on the topic. It is important to note that Noonan is fully aware that she is the embodiment of what she is not: a hacker. As such, she makes no mention of her nature when she talks about research ethics, presumably because she knows she will not get into trouble if she fails to do so."

It's been five years since then, and I'm still amazed at how incredible her work looked when I first saw it. She has never been afraid to use the most cutting-edge techniques, and worked at it with extraordinary care and dedication. We're all so lucky to have had such a skilled, talented and gracious teacher"

A website is soon to go live, with auctions for the two works in the Milton Keynes museum, as well as others for the Tate, auctioneers Bonhams said.
      'What they are going to do is we are going to auction hundreds of pieces from Tate Modern and I think the top end of the list is going to be pretty spectacular,' said Bryce Roberts, a spokesman for Bonhams.

  The match – which will take place at Camp Nou after a 1-1 draw in Naples – is the latest Champions League fixture to be affected by the spread of the virus, with Paris Saint-Germain’s Wednesday return with Borussia Dortmund set to go ahead without supporters, as will Tuesday’s match between Valencia and Atalanta."

  There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.
  Algorithms and user-generated content are out; gatekeepers and fact checking are in.
  Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.
  Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined."

      The video was created by a Belgian political party, Socialistische Partij Anders, or sp.a, and posted on sp.a’s Twitter and Facebook. It provoked hundreds of comments, many expressing outrage that the American president would dare weigh in on Belgium’s climate policy."

      content: "SAN FRANCISCO — Several months ago, Google hired dozens of actors to sit at a table, stand in a hallway and walk down a street while talking into a video camera. Then the company’s researchers, using a new kind of artificial intelligence software, swapped the faces of the actors. People who had been walking were suddenly at a table. The actors who had been in a hallway looked like they were on a street. Men’s faces were put on women’s bodies. Women’s faces were put on men’s bodies. In time, the researchers had created hundreds of so-called deepfake videos."

      Given Mark Zuckerberg's experience with Instagram, I'm not sure if his fast rise is going to last the way he hopes. The company is beginning to see the financial fruits of its social network, but its entire business model may not be sustainable. Investors may soon decide they have had enough."

But why would anyone become an accomplice to fake news when you could just get it by being simple and self-reliant? Like news itself, fake news is something we can't really do anything about; we are not internet-savvy enough to know that if we are to get our heads around it, we need to go ahead and do our own investigation."

      Following its current fourth-quarter ratings, which the network said is the lowest it's seen in the network's history, HBO ordered the 10-episode project titled Thrones.
      Westeros, a fictional continent in Westeros, was devastated by a magical fire and the Lords of Westeros, led by House Targaryen (house Stark), were overthrown.
      The Eastwatch Inn — a storied inn in Kings Landing (the capital city of Westeros) — appeared to be an immediate focal point of the power struggle."

      title: "Fortnite is now one of the biggest games ever with 350 million players"
      content: "Epic’s Fortnite has more than 350 million registered players, the game developer announced on Wednesday. That makes the free-to-play battle royale game one of the most popular titles ever made, ranking up there with the ubiquity of Minecraft and some of the most downloaded mobile and free-to-play PC games of the last 15 years. While we have no indication as to how many players log in every day or month, as Epic doesn’t release those stats, the studio did say that in April alone, players logged 3.2 billion hours of Fortnite.
      The last player count stat we heard from Epic was about 250 million in March 2019, indicating that the game is still growing a year later and more than two and a half years after its initial release. That’s partly due to the game being so readily available on all platforms — PC, console, and mobile — and because Epic continues to update it constantly."

      The company, which reported first quarter earnings for 2020 on Wednesday, says “a record number of people” are using its services, primarily its Messenger and WhatsApp chat apps as well as Instagram. Last month, as the pandemic intensified, Facebook said it was seeing spikes of more than 50 percent on its messaging products and now logs about 700 million daily calls across Messenger and WhatsApp."
